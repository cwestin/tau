- Test producer/consumer pattern
- select from one of multiple channels

(*) Implement pxChannel
- need abstract interface
- need concrete class for intra-loom communication

(*) Implement pxFile, pxInputStream, pxOutputStream
- Use aio.h for reading and writing files, integrate with pxLoom
  - is this just inter-loom communication? Or is there a thread dedicated to
    i/o?

Write script to complete build pipeline to generate an executable
