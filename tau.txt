(*) Define file headers
- Add throughout (in progress)
- set up for doxygen (early experiments not great; considering)

(*) implement pxObject::clone()
- various TODOs

(*) Finish pxHashMapLocal
- should I really finish this? Or should this be implemented in tau space now
  that I have pxHm for clone's use?
- fix average bucket size handling similar to pxHm
- requires cloning objects to clone the key into the right arena

(*) makemake to handle transitive dependencies

(*) Implement pxLoom
- semaphores for producer/consumers, so channels work
- Test producer/consumer pattern
- select from one of multiple channels

(*) Implement pxChannel
- need abstract interface
- need concrete class for intra-loom communication
- need concrete class for iter-loom communication
  - will use pthreads primitives for synchronization?

(*) make pxLoom work across threads
- pthreads, or apr?

(*) Implement pxFile, pxInputStream, pxOutputStream
- Use aio.h for reading and writing files, integrate with pxLoom
  - is this just inter-loom communication? Or is there a thread dedicated to
    i/o?

(*) Build simple starter lexer
- jlex, flex, or antlr4?

(*) Build simple parser for single file program
- CUPS, bison, or antlr4?

(*) Generate C code for simple program
Write script to complete build pipeline to generate an executable
